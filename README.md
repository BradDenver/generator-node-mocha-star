## Credits
This generator is a fork of [generator-node-mocha](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-node) (supporting Mocha unit tests instead of NodeUnit) which is in turn a fork of [generator-node](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-node) by the Yeoman team.

The should.js guide was taken from [grunt-initconfig](https://github.com/pismute/grunt-initconfig/blob/master/src/test/initconfig-test.coffee)
