# Node-Mocha-Star Generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/braddenver/generator-node-mocha-star.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/braddenver/generator-node-mocha-star)

> Create a node.js module with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), including Mocha unit tests, with the assertion library of your choice.

## Installation

Install the generator by running: `npm install -g generator-node-mocha-star`.


## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
yo node-mocha-star
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._


## Credits
This generator is a fork of [generator-node-mocha](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-node) (supporting Mocha unit tests instead of NodeUnit) which is in turn a fork of [generator-node](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-node) by the Yeoman team.
